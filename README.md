# Neuron7X

**Neuron7X** is an autonomous cognitive system designed for dynamic risk analysis, ethical decision-making, fractal memory modeling, and behavioral simulation. Built without external funding or institutional support, the project integrates logic, neuroscience, and AI engineering.

## Key Features
- Cognitive engine with real-time context evaluation
- Fractal memory core with decay, trust, and valence metrics
- Ethics module (HIL-safe, explainability-based decisions)
- Behavioral bifurcation logic and emotional triggers
- EEG/BCI adapter for direct neurofeedback integration

## Status
Prototype core completed (70%). Modules under active integration.
