### 1. LEGAL STATUS AND SCOPE

The “Neuron7X” system is a proprietary cognitive software architecture composed of, but not limited to:  
- Source code and executable logic,  
- Modular architecture and dynamic memory systems,  
- Ethical filters and behavioral simulation algorithms,  
- Contextual adaptation mechanisms and reflexivity modules,  
- Documentation, graphs, formulae, and internal knowledge representations.

All components are the **exclusive intellectual property of the author** and are **not open-source** under any license (MIT, Apache, GPL, etc.). The system is considered a **confidential and original R&D artifact**.

- ❌ Copying, forking, or reverse-engineering any part of the code or architecture  
- ❌ Commercial or military use in any context or jurisdiction  
- ❌ Training or embedding in any AI/LLM/ML system  
- ❌ Integration into production-grade systems without explicit contractual approval  
- ❌ Creating derivative works, including adaptations, simplifications, or reimplementations  
- ❌ Publishing partial or full source code, logic, or architectural diagrams

The following are permitted under strict conditions:

- ✅ Research, academic evaluation, or peer review — with attribution  
- ✅ Personal experimentation in a **non-commercial**, **non-public** local environment  
- ✅ Quoting sections of documentation for scientific or educational purposes — citing the author and source  
- ✅ Inquiries for partnerships, research collaboration, or institutional demonstration — through official contact

---

### 4. CONFIDENTIALITY AND ENFORCEMENT

All unpublished parts of Neuron7X (logic structures, architectural skeletons, or neural models) are considered **confidential IP**.  
Unauthorized disclosure, duplication, or misuse constitutes a **violation of international intellectual property law**, and legal action may be pursued.

---

### 5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

The Neuron7X system is provided **“as is”**, with no warranties, guarantees, or liability of any kind.  
The author is not responsible for:
